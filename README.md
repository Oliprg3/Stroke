Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability. Early identification of stroke risk can save lives and improve recovery outcomes. This project uses PyTorch to train a deep learning model that predicts stroke likelihood based on health and lifestyle data such as age, blood pressure, and glucose levels.

Features:
Processes medical and lifestyle data to predict stroke risk
Uses a neural network implemented in PyTorch
Provides interpretable outputs to highlight the most important risk factors
Can be extended into a web or mobile application for practical use in healthcare

Purpose:
Many people do not have access to regular medical checkups. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in identifying stroke risks early. It is designed to support decision-making and raise awareness of key health indicators.

Technology:
PyTorch for building and training the deep learning model
Python libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data processing and analysis
jupyter notebook for experimentation
optional deployment with streamlit, flask, or fastapi

Future work:
incorporate additional datasets to improve accuracy
add explainability tools to clarify model predictions
deploy as a web or mobile application for real-world use
